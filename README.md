### Guidelines

For this project you will be asked to create a wallet manager.

A wallet is a set of transactions, each containing the following information:

- Currency
- Amount
- Type (debit/credit)

#### User stories

- I want to be able to view my balances grouped by currency
- I want to be able to create a transaction
- I want to be able to update a transaction
- I want to be able to delete a transaction
- I want to be able to delete all transactions for a specific currency

### Tips

1. A store has been implemented using [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) 
and should be used to manage transactions
2. [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) has been installed and can be used for this exercise
3. Existing code can be refactored if needed
